# FesterBlitzer

FesterBlitzer is a sleek heads-up display (HUD) interface that displays real-time vehicle data ‚Äî such as speed and RPM ‚Äî via OBD2. It also fetches and shows the distance to nearby speed cameras (blitzers), helping you stay alert and drive safely.
## üöÄ Getting Started

Before running the application, make sure to update the path to your OBD2 adapter (typically a USB device):


```go
device := initDevice("/dev/tty.usbserial-11340") //in my case
```
For testing purposes, you can use a mock device by setting the path to test://. This allows you to simulate OBD2 responses (see the fork of elmobd for details):

```go
device := initDevice("test://")
```
## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Application

To start the app:

```go
go run main.go
```
